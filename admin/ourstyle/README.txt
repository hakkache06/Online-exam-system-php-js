In order to change the primary color of your Bootstrap in teal color: 

- if you are currently using bootstrap.css replace your bootstrap.css file with the new one downloaded

- if you are currently using bootstrap.min.css replace your bootstrap.min.css file with the new one downloaded

That's it! :)
